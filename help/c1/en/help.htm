<h2 id="L4277">Introduction</h2>

<p>Photoxor C1 is a photography tool for <strong>exposure</strong> and
<strong>depth of field</strong> calculations, <strong>GPS location
tracking</strong>. Visualize locations on a map, and quickly see what's closest
to you.</p>

<p>Use the device camera based <strong>lightmeter</strong> to estimate an
Exposure Value (EV) reading, determine camera settings and calculate
adjustments needed for a (neutral density) <b>filter stack</b>.</p>

<p>The Depth of Field calculation shows the near and far limits of sharpness,
and additionally provides a graphical visualization of the level of sharpness
and diffraction. The Circle of Confusion (CoC) is automatically calculated from
the camera sensor size, but may be overridden with a custom value. A special
<b>CoC calculation</b> screen allows the selection of camera and print
specification. It determines the required sensor CoC and print resolution (DPI)
depending on the anticipated minimum viewing distance.</p>

<p>The Depth of Field calculation also allows specifying the range of sharpness
(near and far limits) and calculates the needed camera settings.</p>

<p><strong>Location tracking</strong> is available to record your path of
travel. You can also record audio notes to quickly store information on your
way. For reference you may want to take geotagged photographs with your device
camera.</p>

<p>A number of in-app purchases are available to further extend
capabilities.</p>

<p>For latest information, tips and tricks please visit the <a
href="http://photoxor.blogspot.com.au/">Photoxor Blog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="L4316">Startup Screen</h2>

<p>The Startup Screen provides the visual entry point into the application.
Icons give you a one-click access to most of the application features. Color
coding is used to present functionality grouping.</p>

<p><img alt="Startup Screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Startup_p.png"
width="295" height="498" /></p>

<h3 id="L4323">Icon Arrangement</h3>

<p>The startup screen presents a number of icons as shortcuts for access to
functionality of the application. The default arrangement might not be the best
for your particular usage, and therefore prefer to rearrange icons. To do this,
<strong>press and hold on the icon</strong> you want to move. On this 'long
press' an array of squares shows up (see image) and you are now able to drag
the chosen icon to one of the squares. As soon as you end the drag, the icon
will be placed on the target square, and the array of squares disappears. In
case you drag to a square already holding an icon, this icon will be moved
away.</p>

<p><img alt="Rearrange icons"
src="../images/Screenshot_Startup_rearrange_icons_p.png" width="295"
height="504" /></p>

<p>Please repeat this process for other icons you want to rearrange. Different
arrangements can be performed for portrait and landscape screen views.</p>

<p>New versions of the application may introduce new icons. They are placed
onto one of the free positions, and you are able to then rearrange these new
icons.</p>

<h2 id="L576">Photography Calculations</h2>

<p>A set of screen is available to perform photography calculations, including
exposure, filter adjustments, depth of field, field of view, circle of
confusion.</p>
<a id="EV"></a> 

<h3 id="L581">Exposure (EV)</h3>

<p>This screen enables you to perform exposure calculations in two ways:
calculate the exposure value from your camera settings, or - in reverse - enter
an exposure value (use the lightmeter for an indicative value) and determine
the best camera settings.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot Exposure" src="../images/Screenshot_ev_p_en.png"
width="295" height="499" /></p>

<p></p>

<h4 id="L205">EV from Camera Settings</h4>

<p>Enter your camera settings</p>
<ul>
  <li>aperture (f/x),</li>
  <li>exposure time in seconds,</li>
  <li>film speed (ISO).</li>
</ul>

<p>The corresponding calculated <strong>exposure value</strong> (EV) is now
shown below together with a short description and an image to indicate the
scenario. The luminance value is expressed in candela per square meter
(cd/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p>To refine the values use the Locks mechanism.</p>

<p>Go to Settings for a change of the Stop system (value increments, for
example values in full stops only or 1/3 stops).</p>

<h4 id="L851">Exposure Value (EV)</h4>

<p>In preparation of a photo shoot you might already know the exposure value of
the scenario. In such case use the slider to enter the exposure value. The
camera settings will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>Press the lock symbol to prevent the EV from changing its value (please note
that for some extreme settings the EV changes due to range limits).</p>

<p>To refine the values use the Locks mechanism.</p>

<h4 id="L864">Locks</h4>

<p>Locks are used to prevent a value from changing. A lock can be open <img
alt="Lock Open" src="../images/ic_lock_open.png" width="48" height="47" />or
closed<img alt="Lock closed" src="../images/ic_lock_closed.png" width="47"
height="47" />.</p>

<p>Please note that on this screen only two of the four locks can be in a
locked state. When you change one of the unlocked values, the other unlocked
value will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<a id="Lightmeter"></a> 

<h4 id="L222">Lightmeter</h4>

<p>If your device is equipped with a camera, you may use it as a simple
<strong>light meter</strong>. The light meter takes a picture and sets the EV
according to the exposure details of the image. The EV will become locked. The
accuracy of the recorded exposure value (EV) depends on your device.</p>

<p>In case no camera can be accessed the light meter button is deactivated.</p>
<a id="Filter"></a> 

<h3 id="L586">Filter Stack (FILTER)</h3>

<p>The Filter screen is used to adjust camera settings by the amount of light
reduction from one or more attached neutral density (ND) filters. This is in
particular useful for very dark filters, often called 'Black Glass', where
exposure measurement through the DSLR camera is not possible.</p>

<p>An article with a step by step guide can be found on the <a
href="http://photoxor.blogspot.com.au/2014/10/how-to-calculate-exposure-for-black.html">Photoxor
Blog</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot Filter Stack"
src="../images/Screenshot_filter_p_en.png" width="295" height="503" /></p>

<h4 id="L1067">Camera Settings without Filter</h4>

<p>Here you enter the camera settings without the filter(s) attached. You can
use the Exposure (EV) screen to calculate these settings, and then move to this
Filter screen. </p>

<p>Note: In case a filter is attached already (such as a protective or UV
filter), there is not need to remove, just don't add to the filter stack.</p>

<h4 id="L1076">Filter Stack</h4>

<p>Now enter the neutral density filters you intend to mount on you camera. The
free version allows to set one filter only, whereas the 'Filter-Stack' in-app
purchase supports a stack of multiple filters and also fractional light
reduction values.</p>

<h4 id="L1081">Then Set Camera To</h4>

<p>Here you find the camera setting reflecting the light reduction once the
filters are attached. Using these settings gives your image about the same
exposure level as using the original settings without filter.</p>

<p>In case you find a difference in exposure, either the light situation might
have changed (for example during sunset), or the filter light reduction values
are not exactly correct. In case you require more precise values you should
perform some tests beforehand and adjust the light reduction value within the
filter definition.</p>
<a id="Dof"></a> 

<h3 id="L591">Depth of Field (DOF)</h3>

<p>This screen allows to calculate the Depth of Field (DoF) for a given
scenario.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot Depth of Field Standard"
src="../images/Screenshot_dof_p_en.png" width="295" height="503" /></p>

<p>For this calculation you select your camera, aperture, focal length,
distance and optionally adjust the Circle of Confusion (CoC) value (for
advanced scenarios use the CoC calculation screen). The depth of field is then
shown with near and far distance values. The hyperfocal length is calculated,
too.</p>

<p>For focal length and also distance you can either use the (logarithmic)
sliders to quickly set approximate values or use the entry fields for a precise
value. Distance values can be shown and entered either in meter or feet.</p>

<p>The Circle of Confusion (CoC) is determined from the camera details based on
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeiss_formula">Zeiss formula</a>, but
you may select your own value.</p>

<p>Please note that near, far and hyperfocal distances are currently calculated
based on the set CoC value without consideration of diffraction.</p>

<p>The graph presents three CoC lines depending on the distance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the calculated CoC value for the distance (yellow line),</li>
  <li>the CoC plus diffraction (dotted red line),</li>
  <li>the reference CoC (black dotted line) as the (sometimes a bit arbitrary)
    boundary between 'sharp' and 'blur'.</li>
</ul>

<p>The distance where the CoC value is below the reference value is considered
as 'sharp'; lower CoC values indicate higher sharpness.</p>

<p>Use this graph to quickly visualize changes to the sharpness range.</p>

<p>Press on the graph area to show or hide the legend.</p>

<p>In case you need to define a new camera characteristics or amend, press the
settings button<img alt="Settings" src="../images/ic_action_settings.png"
width="48" height="48" /> next to the camera. Also go to Settings for a change
of the aperture value increment (for example full stops only or 1/3 stops).</p>
<a id="DofRange"></a> 

<h3 id="L257">Depth of Field - Near / Far (DOF NEAR/FAR)</h3>

<p>This Depth of Field calculation is often also called 'reverse DoF
calculation'. It allows you to specify a distance range where you require
sharpness, and calculates camera settings.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot Depth of Field, Near / Far"
src="../images/Screenshot_dof_nf_p_en.png" width="295" height="503" /></p>

<p>Please note that such calculation works well for 'realistic' values, but
might fail for more extreme scenarios.</p>

<p>The graph is the same as for the standard DoF calculation.</p>
<a id="CocCalc"></a> 

<h3 id="L596">CoC</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_confusion">CoC</a> value
used for Depth of Field calculations is traditionally based on the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeiss_formula">Zeiss formula</a>, which uses
a print size of 30cm x 20cm viewed from 25cm distance (the comfortable viewing
distance for the human eye). For general calculations this CoC value is often
satisfactory.</p>

<p>To produce high-quality prints a more refined CoC value is required. This
calculation screen removes guessing, and allows to perform non-standard CoC
calculations based on a camera sensor and print specification. It determines
the required sensor CoC and print resolution (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">DPI</a>) depending on the
anticipated minimum viewing distance. And it helps you to also understand the
scenario where the print resolution is a given factor.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshop CoC Calculation"
src="../images/Screenshot_CoC_Calc_p_en.png" width="295" height="561" /></p>

<p>To calculate a CoC value specific to your requirements first select your
camera. Important is the correct sensor size. Use the <img alt="Settings"
src="../images/ic_action_settings.png" width="48" height="48" /> icon next to
the camera selection if you would like to create a new camera setting or amend
an existing one.</p>

<p>Next you need to decide on the print size of the planned image. Here as
well, use the <img alt="Settings" src="../images/ic_action_settings.png"
width="48" height="48" /> icon next to the print selection if you would like to
create a new print definition or amend an existing one. Most important is the
size of the print.</p>

<p>Usually the calculation is based on the width, but you may alternatively use
height or diagonal. Depending on you preference, choose your unit of
measurement.</p>

<p>The application now calculates the 'comfortable' viewing distance for a
human eye. This is based on the viewing angle. If you have purchased the
high-precision extension, you are able to amend the angle (standard is 60
degree).</p>

<p>It also calculates the minimum required print resolution in Dots per Inch
(DPI), and the required sensor CoC. This calculation is also based on the human
eye resolution. The standard value is 5 lp/mm. If you have purchased the
high-precision extension, you are able to amend this value.</p>

<p>The next section allows you to define a <strong>minimum viewing
distance</strong>. The viewer of your print might first observe at the
'comfortable' viewing distance, but then get closer to inspect details. If you
use the CoC standard calculation the sharpness then might not be satisfactory
any more. Enter the anticipated minimum viewing distance and get the required
print resolution (DPI) and CoC.</p>

<p>The following section is based on the <strong>print resolution</strong>. For
a given print resolution you are able to determine what would be minimum
acceptable viewing distance and the matching CoC.</p>
<a id="Fov"></a> 

<h3 id="L608">Field of View (FOV)</h3>

<p>How far do you need to stand back to capture a large building? Here the
Field of View calculation screen is used.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot Field of View" src="../images/Screenshot_fov_p_en.png"
width="295" height="504" /></p>

<p>Select the type of camera used and the focal length of the lens; this
determines the angle of view, which is shown for both width and height. Now
increase or decrease the distance until you get a Height value larger than the
building height.</p>

<p>In reverse, if you have got a zoom lense, enter your distance from the
object and change the focal length until the Height value larger than the
building height.</p>

<p>The Field of View screen supports both dimensional and angular
calculation.</p>

<p>As for most of the other calculation screens, the focus distance can be
either set using the (logarithmic) slider or the entry field. The focal length
can be set in the same way.</p>

<p>Distance values can be entered and shown either in meter or feet.</p>

<p>In case you need to define a new camera characteristics, press the settings
button <img alt="Settings" src="../images/ic_action_settings.png" width="48"
height="48" /> next to the camera and add a new one.</p>

<h2 id="L4334">Tracking</h2>
Use GPS tracking to log your movement path to a file or display on a map. 

<p>Three screens (tabs) are available: TRACKING, MAP, PLACES</p>

<h3 id="L4342">TRACKING Screen</h3>

<p>From the Startup screen press the Tracking icon to reach the tracking
functionality.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking Icon" src="../images/Tracking Icon.png" width="80"
height="86" /></p>

<p>The tracking screen offers two key functionalities:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Tracking</dt>
    <dd>A location provider (such as GPS) is used to determine the current
      location coordinates, and often also other details such as altitude,
      speed and bearing of movement. This information is shown on the screen
      and updated when available.</dd>
    <dd>For GPS coordinates - depending on your device - it may take some time
      until the first fix is locked. In some instances, in particular within
      buildings you might not receive a GPS fix at all.</dd>
    <dd>The location provider can be changed in <em>Settings</em>, also while
      <em>Logging</em> is active.</dd>
  <dt>Logging</dt>
    <dd>The current location information is recorded. It can be stored to a
      file where both GPX and KML formats are supported, or shown on the MAP
      screen only.</dd>
    <dd>When you switch on <em>Logging</em>, the <em>Tracking</em>
      functionality is automatically enabled as well. You are able to switch
      off <em>Tracking</em> while <em>Logging</em> continues to be active. This
      can be used to save energy for example while inside a building or
      stationary at a location for some time.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img alt="Tracking screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Tracking_en_p.png"
width="295" height="504" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>While Logging is active both audio recordings and photos (taken with device
camera) can be associated with the current location. You might use this feature
to quickly record information about a place. For such recordings a marker is
shown on the map.</p>

<h4 id="L4396">Audio Recording</h4>

<p>Wile Logging is active you are able to record an audio message. This
recording is geocoded with the current location. In case the track is presented
on the map (MAP screen) then a marker icon in shape of a microphone is
shown.</p>

<p>Within Settings you can change the recording format between 3GP, MPEG4, AMR.
The recording file is stored in a folder for media files associated with the
track. The name is shown during the audio recording dialog.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Audio Recording"
src="../images/Screenshot_Tracking_Audio_recording_p.png" width="295"
height="505" /></p>

<h4 id="L4401">Finish Logging</h4>

<p><a id="audioRecording" name="audioRecording"></a>When you finish logging a
dialog appears to select what action to take. Use <em>Cancel</em> in case you
switched off logging in error.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking Stop Logging Screen"
src="../images/Screenshot_Tracking_Stop_Logging_Share.png" width="295"
height="175" /></p>

<p>You can <strong>share</strong> the log file, for example upload to cloud
storage, send via email, ...</p>

<p>Depending on your settings (see Settings) the log file together with audio
recordings and photos will be packaged as a ZIP file.</p>

<p>Please note that in case no records (for example no GPS fix could be
obtained yet) are logged when you stop, no data from that session are available
for sharing. Therefore in such situation pressing Share brings up a file
dialog. You can then either select an old recording for sharing or abort.</p>

<p>The following log file formats are supported:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>GPX</dt>
    <dd>The GPX file format records the path with timestamp, location
      coordinates, speed, course, elevation.</dd>
    <dd>This format is suitable for input into tools such as Adobe
    Lightroom.</dd>
  <dt>KML</dt>
    <dd>The KML file format records the path with timestamp and location
      coordinates.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="L4432">MAP Screen</h3>

<p>The MAP screen is based on Google Maps. It allows you to display the
recorded path, a previously logged path, or mark places (see PLACES screen).</p>

<p>To show the map, Internet connectivity is required. You may use Google Map
to persist a map area for offline access.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Map Screen (Path)"
src="../images/Screenshot_Map_path_p.png" width="295" height="502" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Map Screen (Places)"
src="../images/Screenshot_Map_p.png" width="295" height="503" /></p>

<p>The <strong><em>Logger</em> </strong>button<strong></strong> is used to
present the currently logged path on the map. Special markers are shown for
audio recordings and photos taken.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Load Log File</em> </strong>button<strong></strong> allows
to load an existing log file and present the path on the map.</p>

<p>Use the <strong><em>None</em> </strong>button<strong></strong> to clear all
markers and path.</p>
<a id="places"></a> 

<h3 id="L4469">PLACES Screen</h3>

<p>The PLACES screen is used to load places (<strong><em>Load KML</em>
</strong>button<strong></strong>) of interest from KML files.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Places Screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Places_p.png"
width="295" height="505" /></p>

<p>The list of loaded places can be sorted either alphabetically or by distance
from current location (if current location is available).</p>

<p>Click on one place and the MAP screen is shown, positioned for this
place.</p>

<p>Use the <strong><em>On Map</em> </strong>button<strong></strong> to put
markers for all places in the list onto the map (does not automatically move to
MAP screen!). You can do this for multiple places lists.</p>

<h2 id="L21478">In-App Purchases</h2>

<p>Additional features can be purchased for the application (in-app purchases).
Such features extend the capabilities of the free version.</p>

<p>The purchase is performed through Google Play.</p>

<h3 id="L21490">No-Advertisement</h3>

<p>Get more screen space by removing the advertisement banner. Also the
interstitional adverts (ads shown between pages) will be suppressed.</p>

<h3 id="L21502">High Precision Values</h3>

<p>This feature increases calculation precision.</p>

<p>The free application is fixed to 3 significant digits result values. This
extensions allows to configure between 2 and 8 significant digits results for
</p>

<p>depth of field and field of view calculations.</p>

<p>For CoC calculations this option enables configuration of the comfortable
human eye viewing angle and human eye resolution.</p>

<h3 id="L21507">Filter Stack</h3>

<p>Extend your exposure calculations with a Filter Stack and more precise
filter definition.</p>

<p>This feature allows the definition of multiple stacked (neutral density)
filters and calculate the resulting effect.</p>

<p>The light reduction factor can be defined more precisely in 1/10th of a
Stop, i.e. 9.9, 10.0, 10.1.</p>

width="400" height="302" /></p>

<p>The definition lists do provide the following common features:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Add ...</dt>
    <dd>The Add button allows to create a new definition. A dialog is presented
      for entry of specific values. All definitions use a name and optional
      make for identification.</dd>
  <dt>Scrolling</dt>
    <dd>For scrolling of the list touch and move on the right side (outside of
      the gray area). This function is only available in case not all of the
      items within the list can be shown.</dd>
  <dt>Export</dt>
    <dd>Use the Export button to export all or some of the definitions to a XML
      file. A dialog allows the selection of the definitions to be
    exported.</dd>
    <dd>The export file must have a suffix of <em>.xml</em> or <em>.XML</em>,
      otherwise <em>.xml</em> will be appended automatically.</dd>
  <dt>Import</dt>
    <dd>Use the Import button to import definitions from an XML file. Usually
      this file would be the result of a previous export. You may use the
      Export / Import functionality</dd>
    <dd>to transfer definitions between devices running the application.</dd>
    <dd>The file must have a suffix of <em>.xml</em> or <em>.XML</em>. to show
      in the file selection. A dialog allows the selection of the definitions
      to be imported.</dd>
    <dd><strong>Replace</strong>: The original list is replaced by the imported
      definitions. <em>Please note that the original definitions are
      permanently deleted, and cannot be recovered.</em></dd>
    <dd><strong>Add</strong>: The imported definitions are added to the
      original list.</dd>
  <dt>Reorder</dt>
    <dd>You might prefer to show the most often used definitions at the
      beginning of the list.</dd>
    <dd>To rearrange an item, touch the line on the left side (inside of
      thegray area) and drag to a new location.</dd>
  <dt>Delete Definition</dt>
    <dd>To delete a definition, touch the line on the right side (outside of
      the gray area) and swipe to the right. The item will disappear from the
      list and transferred to the archive. Use the archive function in case of
      accidental deletion.</dd>
  <dt>Archive</dt>
    <dd>Deleted definitions are held in a temporary archive while the
      application is running. In case you accidentally delete a definition, use
      this archive to restore it.</dd>
    <dd>Whenever definitions are stored in the archive, the <img
      alt="Archive icon" src="../images/ic_menu_delete.png" width="64"
      height="64" /> icon is shown above the list, together with the number of
      items held. Click on this icon for a list of </dd>
    <dd>archived definitions. From the list select the items you would like to
      recover. Once restored an item is removed from the archive.</dd>
  <dt>Reset</dt>
    <dd>You can reset this list to default values; please note that all own
      definitions and customizations are permanently lost.</dd>

<h5 id="L3695">Settings - Cameras</h5>
Camera definitions are used for various calculations, such as field of view,
but also to determine the circle of confusion (CoC) for Depth of Field (DoF)
calculations. 
<dl>
  <dt>Sensor</dt>
    <dd>The sensor size is defined in millimeter (mm).</dd>
  <dt>Lens</dt>
    <dd>In case your camera is fitted with a fixed lens, you are able to define
      the basic characteristics, which is then used to populate screens
      accordingly. 
      <p>For a fixed lens, tick the checkbox and enter the minimum and maximum
      focal length. In case of a prime lens, enter the same value in both
      fields. The focal length is</p>
      <p>entered in millimeter (mm).</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>CoC</dt>
    <dd>The default CoC value is calculated from the sensor size based on the
      Zeiss formula and shown in micrometer (µm).</dd>
    <dd>You may define your own CoC value, entered in micrometer (µm).</dd>
</dl>
<a id="FilterList"></a> <a id="FilterDetails"></a> 

<h5 id="L3697">Settings - Filters</h5>
Filter definitions are used in exposure calculations to determine the level of
light reductions. Currently all filters are treated as neutral density (ND)
filters characterized by the level of light reduction. 
<dl>
  <dt>F-Stop Reduction</dt>
    <dd>The reduction of light is entered in the number stops.</dd>
    <dd>If you purchased to <em>Filter Stack</em> option, then a fractional
      stop value can be entered and used for the calculation.</dd>
</dl>
<a id="PrintDefsList"></a> <a id="PrintDefDetails"></a> 

<h5 id="L3699">Settings - Print Definitions</h5>

<p>Print definitions are used for the specialized calculation of the circle of
confusion (CoC) for Depth of Field (DoF) based on both print and camera sensor
characteristics.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Size</dt>
    <dd>The print size is defined by width and height in meter.</dd>
  <dt>Resolution</dt>
    <dd>The print resolution is entered in dots per inch (DPI).</dd>
    <dd>The resolution is used to calculate a minimum viewing distance, where
      the human eye considers the print still as sharp. It is also used to
      calculate the corresponding sensor CoC.</dd>
  <dt>Viewing Distance</dt>
    <dd>The anticipated closest viewing distance is entered in meter.</dd>
    <dd>By default the CoC calculation uses the natural human viewing distance
      based on the 'comfortable' viewing angle of the human eye. This is often
      a good value, but in some circumstance you may want to provide an
      explicit minimum viewing distance. For example, the viewer is unable to
      get any closer to the print, and therefor the sharpness requirements are
      less. Alternatively, you might anticipate the view to perform a 'close
      inspection' and still would like to present the image with full
    sharpness.</dd>
  <dt>Notes</dt>
    <dd>You may enter some notes to describe the print definition.</dd>
    <dd>This information is not used for calculation purposes.</dd>
</dl>
