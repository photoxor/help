<h2 id="L4277">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is for Photoxor C1 version 1.4.7 (49), which can be installed
or updated for free from <a name="Google" id="Google"
href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.photoxor.fotoapp">Google
Play</a>.</p>

<p>Photoxor C1 is a photography tool for <strong>exposure</strong>,
<strong>depth of field</strong>, <strong>flash, filter</strong>,
<strong>CoC</strong> calculations, <strong>GPS location tracking</strong>,
ephemeris <strong>sun and moon calculations </strong>with
<strong>compass</strong>. Visualize locations on a map, and quickly see what's
closest to you.</p>

<p>Use the device camera based <strong>lightmeter</strong> to estimate an
Exposure Value (EV) reading, determine camera settings and calculate
adjustments needed for a (neutral density) <b>filter stack</b>.</p>

<p>The Depth of Field calculation shows the near and far limits of sharpness,
and additionally provides a graphical visualization of the level of sharpness
and diffraction. The Circle of Confusion (CoC) is automatically calculated from
the camera sensor size, but may be overridden with a custom value. A special
<b>CoC calculation</b> screen allows the selection of camera and print
specification. It determines the required sensor CoC and print resolution (DPI)
depending on the anticipated minimum viewing distance.</p>

<p>The Depth of Field calculation also allows specifying the range of sharpness
(near and far limits) and calculates the needed camera settings.</p>

<p><strong>Location tracking</strong> is available to record your path of
travel. You can also record audio notes to quickly store information on your
way. For reference you may want to take geotagged photographs with your device
camera.</p>

<p>Ephemeris sun and moon calculations allow you to determine Golden and Blue
Hours, direction of sun and moon and much more.</p>

<p>An application <strong>widget</strong> allows quick access to Logging and
Tracking, and also provides a <strong>Torch</strong> function.</p>

<p>A number of in-app purchases are available to further extend
capabilities.</p>

<p>For latest information, tips and tricks please visit the <a
href="http://photoxor.blogspot.com.au/">Photoxor Blog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="L4316">Startup Screen</h2>

<p>The Startup Screen provides the visual entry point into the application.
Icons give you a one-click access to most of the application features. Color
coding is used to present functionality grouping.</p>

<p>Please click the icon button to open the function screen.</p>

<p><img alt="Startup Screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Startup_p.png"
width="295" height="498" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>There is one exception: the Torch function does not open a screen, but
switches the Torch on or off:</p>

<p><img alt="icon torch" src="../images/Start-Icon-Torch_en.png" width="80"
height="80" /></p>

<p>Please note that the torch icon is only shown if the device supports a
camera flash function (the LED used by the torch).</p>

<h3 id="L4323">Icon Arrangement</h3>

<p>The startup screen presents a number of icons as shortcuts for access to
functionality of the application. The default arrangement might not be the best
for your particular usage, and therefore prefer to rearrange icons. To do this,
<strong>press and hold on the icon</strong> you want to move. On this 'long
press' an array of squares shows up (see image) and you are now able to drag
the chosen icon to one of the squares. As soon as you end the drag, the icon
will be placed on the target square, and the array of squares disappears. In
case you drag to a square already holding an icon, this icon will be moved
away.</p>

<p><img alt="Rearrange icons"
src="../images/Screenshot_Startup_rearrange_icons_p.png" width="295"
height="504" /></p>

<p>Please repeat this process for other icons you want to rearrange. Separate
arrangements can be performed for portrait and landscape screen views.</p>

<p>New versions of the application may introduce new icons. They are placed
onto one of the free positions, and you are able to then rearrange these new
icons.</p>

<h3 id="L1920">Navigation Drawer</h3>

<p>The Navigation Drawer is an additional feature to quickly access application
functionality. To open the drawer please press the top left area of the action
bar (where you see the three horizontal lines, the Photoxor icon and the
application name Photoxor C1. The navigation drawer opens and you are able to
scroll through the functions provided. Click on one of the functions and
directly go to the screen.</p>

<p><img alt="navigation drawer" src="../images/Screenshot_NavDrawer_en.png"
width="295" height="484" /></p>

<h2 id="L4883">Application Widget</h2>

<p>When you install Photoxor C1 an application widget is installed as well. You
can find it in the list of widgets for your device.</p>

<p><img alt="widget" src="../images/Screenshot_Widget_en.png" width="295"
height="70" /></p>

<p>The widget provides</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Photoxor icon to quickly start the application.</li>
  <li>The Tracking icon switches location tracking on / off.</li>
  <li>The Logging icon switches location logging on / off. On switching off the
    log data are written to a logging file (as configured in Settings).</li>
  <li>The Torch icon switches the torch on / off. Please note the automatic
    switch-off time, which can be configured in Settings. This function is
    implemented to protect battery usage and avoid overheating of device.
    Default is a 30 seconds on time.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case the torch function is not supported by the device, the torch button
is not presented and the widget looks like this:</p>

<p><img alt="widget without torch button"
src="../images/Screenshot_Widget_no_torch_en.png" width="262" height="70" /></p>

<h2 id="L576">Photography Calculations</h2>

<p>A set of screen is available to perform photography calculations, including
exposure, filter adjustments, depth of field, field of view, circle of
confusion. </p>

<h3 id="L581">Exposure (EV)</h3>

<p>This screen enables you to perform exposure calculations in two ways:
calculate the exposure value from your camera settings, or - in reverse - enter
an exposure value (use the <a href="#L222">lightmeter</a> for an indicative
value) and determine the best camera settings.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot Exposure" src="../images/Screenshot_ev_p_en.png"
width="295" height="499" /></p>

<p></p>

<h4 id="L205">EV from Camera Settings</h4>

<p>Enter your camera settings</p>
<ul>
  <li>aperture (f/x),</li>
  <li>exposure time in seconds,</li>
  <li>film speed (ISO).</li>
</ul>

<p>The corresponding calculated <strong>exposure value</strong> (EV) is now
shown below, together with a short description and an image to indicate a
typical scenario. The luminance value is expressed in candela per square meter
(cd/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p>To refine the values use the <a href="#L864">Locks mechanism</a>.</p>

<p>Go to Settings for a change of the Stop system (value increments, for
example values in full stops only or 1/3 stops).</p>

<h4 id="L851">Exposure Value (EV)</h4>

<p>In preparation of a photo shoot you might already know the exposure value of
the scenario. In such case use the slider to enter the exposure value. The
camera settings will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>Press the lock symbol to prevent the EV from changing its value (please note
that for some extreme settings the EV changes due to range limits).</p>

<p>To refine the values use the Locks mechanism.</p>

<h4 id="L864">Locks</h4>

<p>Locks are used to prevent a value from changing. A lock can be open <img
alt="Lock Open" src="../images/ic_lock_open.png" width="48" height="47" />or
closed<img alt="Lock closed" src="../images/ic_lock_closed.png" width="47"
height="47" />.</p>

<p>Please note that on this screen only two of the four locks can be in a
locked state. When you change one of the unlocked values, the other unlocked
value will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<a id="Lightmeter"></a> 

<h4 id="L222">Lightmeter</h4>

<p>There are two types of lightmeter function available. One uses the device
camera, the other the device light sensor.The buttons are only enabled if the
device is fitted with camera / sensor.</p>

<p>If your device is equipped with a <strong>camera</strong>, you may use it as
a simple <strong>light meter</strong>. The light meter takes a picture and sets
the EV according to the exposure details of the image. The EV will become
locked. The accuracy of the recorded exposure value (EV) depends on your
device.</p>
If your device is equipped with a <strong>light sensor</strong>, you may use
this sensor to measure illuminance. Press the Light Sensor button and a dialog
window is shown. The measured light intensity is shown in lux together with the
calculated exposure value (EV). Once you accept the measurement, the EV is set
and become locked. Camera settings are adjusted to reflect the EV. <a
id="Filter"></a> 

<h3 id="L586">Filter Stack (FILTER)</h3>

<p>The Filter screen is used to adjust camera settings by the amount of light
reduction from one or more attached neutral density (ND) filters. This is in
particular useful for very dark filters, often called 'Black Glass', where
exposure measurement through the DSLR camera is not possible.</p>

<p>An article with a step by step guide can be found on the <a
href="http://photoxor.blogspot.com.au/2014/10/how-to-calculate-exposure-for-black.html">Photoxor
Blog</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot Filter Stack"
src="../images/Screenshot_filter_p_en.png" width="295" height="503" /></p>

<h4 id="L1067">Camera Settings without Filter</h4>

<p>Here you enter the camera settings without the filter(s) attached. You can
use the Exposure (EV) screen to calculate these settings, and then move to this
Filter screen. </p>

<p>TIp: In case a filter is attached already (such as a protective or UV
filter), there is not need to remove, just don't add to the filter stack.</p>

<h5 id="L8449">User Presets</h5>

<p>User exposure settings allow you to quickly preset your preferred camera
settings for various lighting conditions. The free version gives you two
settings using the blue buttons. Purchasing the Filter Pro add-on enables the
use of named presets, which are access with the golden button.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><img alt="user EV 1" src="../images/Button_EV_User1.png" width="26"
  height="26" /> or <img alt="user EV 2" src="../images/Button_EV_User2.png"
  width="26" height="26" /></dt>
    <dd>Select aperture, exposure time and film speed and then perform a 'long'
      click on one of the blue buttons to store the setting. To recall the
      stored setting perform a 'short' click.</dd>
  <dt><img alt="User EV Selection List" src="../images/Button_User_Sel.png"
  width="26" height="26" /></dt>
    <dd>Select aperture, exposure time and film speed and then perform a 'long'
      click on the golden button. This brings up a dialog to store the current
      settings.</dd>
    <dd>To recall a setting perform a 'short' click, which shows a dialog to
      select one of the name stored settings. You are also able to add the
      current setting as a new preset or go to the list of presets.</dd>
    <dd><img alt="EV selection dialog"
      src="../images/Screenshot_evsettingsel_dialog_p_en.png" /></dd>
  <dt></dt>
</dl>

<h4 id="L1076">Filter Stack</h4>

<p>Now enter the neutral density filters you intend to mount on you camera. The
free version allows to set one filter only, whereas the 'Filter-Stack' in-app
purchase supports a stack of multiple filters and also fractional light
reduction values.</p>

<h4 id="L1081">Then Set Camera To</h4>

<p>Here you find the camera setting reflecting the light reduction once the
filters are attached. Using these settings gives your image about the same
exposure level as using the original settings without filter.</p>

<p>In case you find a difference in exposure, either the light situation might
have changed (for example during sunset), or the filter light reduction values
are not exactly correct. In case you require more precise values you should
perform some tests beforehand and adjust the light reduction value within the
filter definition.</p>
<a id="ExposureTimer"></a> 

<h4 id="L4826">Exposure Timer</h4>

<p>For exposure times (with filter attached) of 3 or more seconds a countdown
timer is available. This timer can be started by pressing the<img
alt="Start Timer" src="../images/ic_start_timer.png" width="48" height="48" />
button. Then a dialog window is presented for the countdown. When finished a
notification is performed. This can be configured in <a
href="#L6032">Settings</a> as sounding a notification ringtone, vibrate or
switching on the flash LED (if available). The countdown may be cancelled using
the Cancel button at any time.</p>

<p>This timer is in particular useful in case your camera does not provide a
built-in setting for the calculated exposure time. Then set the camera to BULB
mode and start the timer when you press the shutter release. When the timer
raises the notification alarm press the camera release to close the shutter.
</p>
<a id="Dof"></a> 

<h3 id="L591">Depth of Field (DOF)</h3>

<p>This screen allows to calculate the Depth of Field (DoF) for a given
scenario.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot Depth of Field Standard"
src="../images/Screenshot_dof_p_en.png" width="295" height="503" /></p>

<p>For this calculation you select your camera, aperture, focal length,
distance and optionally adjust the Circle of Confusion (CoC) value (for
advanced scenarios use the <a href="#L596">CoC calculation screen</a>). The
depth of field is then shown with near and far distance values. The hyperfocal
length is calculated, too.</p>

<p>For focal length and also distance you can either use the (logarithmic)
sliders to quickly set approximate values or use the entry fields for a precise
value. Distance values can be shown and entered either in meter or feet.</p>

<p>The Circle of Confusion (CoC) is determined from the camera details based on
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeiss_formula">Zeiss formula</a>, but
you may select your own value.</p>

<p>Please note that near, far and hyperfocal distances are currently calculated
based on the set CoC value without consideration of diffraction.</p>

<p>The graph presents three CoC lines depending on the distance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the calculated CoC value for the distance (yellow line),</li>
  <li>the CoC plus diffraction (dotted red line),</li>
  <li>the reference CoC (black dotted line) as the (sometimes a bit arbitrary)
    boundary between 'sharp' and 'blur'.</li>
</ul>

<p>The distance value where the CoC value is below the reference value is
considered as 'sharp'; lower CoC values indicate higher sharpness.</p>

<p>Use this graph to quickly visualize changes to the sharpness range.</p>

<p>Press on the graph area to show or hide the legend.</p>

<p>In case you need to define a new <a href="#L3695">camera characteristics</a>
or amend, press the settings button<img alt="Settings"
src="../images/ic_action_settings.png" width="48" height="48" /> next to the
camera. Also go to Settings for a change of the aperture value increment (for
example full stops only or 1/3 stops).</p>
<a id="DofRange"></a> 

<h3 id="L257">Depth of Field - Near / Far (DOF NEAR/FAR)</h3>

<p>This Depth of Field calculation is often also called 'reverse DoF
calculation'. It allows you to specify a distance range where you require
sharpness, and calculates camera settings.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot Depth of Field, Near / Far"
src="../images/Screenshot_dof_nf_p_en.png" width="295" height="503" /></p>

<p>Please note that such calculation works well for 'realistic' values, but
might fail for more extreme scenarios.</p>

<p>The graph is the same as for the standard DoF calculation.</p>
<a id="CocCalc"></a> 

<h3 id="L596">CoC</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_confusion">CoC</a> value
used for <a href="#Dof">Depth of Field calculations</a> is traditionally based
on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeiss_formula">Zeiss formula</a>,
which uses a print size of 30cm x 20cm viewed from 25cm distance (the
comfortable viewing distance for the human eye). For general calculations this
CoC value is often satisfactory.</p>

<p>To produce high-quality prints a more refined CoC value is required. This
calculation screen removes guessing, and allows to perform non-standard CoC
calculations based on a camera sensor and print specification. It determines
the required sensor CoC and print resolution (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">DPI</a>) depending on the
anticipated minimum viewing distance. And it helps you to also understand a
scenario where the print resolution is a given factor.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshop CoC Calculation"
src="../images/Screenshot_CoC_Calc_p_en.png" width="295" height="561" /></p>

<p>To calculate a CoC value specific to your requirements first select your
camera. Important is the correct sensor size. Use the <img alt="Settings"
src="../images/ic_action_settings.png" width="48" height="48" /> icon next to
the camera selection if you would like to create a new <a href="#L3695">camera
setting</a> or amend an existing one.</p>

<p>Next you need to decide on the print size of the planned image. Here as
well, use the <img alt="Settings" src="../images/ic_action_settings.png"
width="48" height="48" /> icon next to the print selection if you would like to
create a new <a href="#L3699">print definition</a> or amend an existing one.
Most important is the size of the print.</p>

<p>Usually the calculation is based on the width, but you may alternatively use
height or diagonal. Depending on you preference, choose your unit of
measurement.</p>

<p>The application now calculates the 'comfortable' viewing distance for a
human eye. This is based on the viewing angle. If you have purchased the
high-precision extension, you are able to amend the angle (standard is 60
degree) in Settings.</p>

<p>It also calculates the minimum required print resolution in Dots per Inch
(DPI), and the required sensor CoC value. This calculation is also based on the
human eye resolution. The standard value is 5 lp/mm. If you have purchased the
high-precision extension, you are able to amend this value in Settings.</p>

<p>The next section allows you to define a <strong>minimum viewing
distance</strong>. The viewer of your print might first observe at the
'comfortable' viewing distance, but then get closer to inspect details. If you
use the CoC standard calculation the sharpness then might not be satisfactory
any more. Enter the anticipated minimum viewing distance and get the required
print resolution (DPI) and CoC.</p>

<p>The following section is based on the <strong>print resolution</strong>. For
a given print resolution you are able to determine what would be the minimum
acceptable viewing distance and the matching CoC.</p>
<a id="Fov"></a> 

<h3 id="L608">Field of View (FOV)</h3>

<p>How far do you need to stand back to capture a large building? Here the
Field of View calculation screen is used.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot Field of View" src="../images/Screenshot_fov_p_en.png"
width="295" height="504" /></p>

<p>Select the type of camera used and the focal length of the lens; this
determines the angle of view, which is shown for both width and height. Now
increase or decrease the distance until you get a Height value larger than the
building height.</p>

<p>In reverse, if you have got a zoom lens, enter your distance from the object
and change the focal length until the Height value is larger than the building
height.</p>

<p>The Field of View screen supports both dimensional and angular
calculation.</p>

<p>As for most of the other calculation screens, the focus distance can be
either set using the (logarithmic) slider or the entry field. The focal length
can be set in the same way.</p>

<p>Distance values can be entered and shown either in meter or feet.</p>

<p>In case you need to define a new c<a href="#L3695">amera
characteristics</a>, press the settings button <img alt="Settings"
src="../images/ic_action_settings.png" width="48" height="48" /> next to the
camera and add a new one.</p>
<a id="Flash"></a> 

<h3 id="L12559">Flash</h3>
The Flash screen helps to perform flash related calculations to determine the
reach of a flash unit. 

<p><img alt="Flash screen" src="../images/Screenshot_flash_p_en.png"
width="295" height="504" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>First select the flash unit and guide number profile, and you get the guide
number for this configuration. If needed you are able to manually change the
guide number value. Next choose the output power, film speed (ISO) and
aperture, and receive the distance.</p>

<p>You may display distance related values (i.e. distance and guide number) in
either Meter or Feet.</p>

<p>Please note that without the Flash Pro add-on only one guide number profile
can be set (exception are the sample flash definitions).</p>

<p>In case you need to define a new flash characteristics, press the settings
button<img alt="settings button" src="../images/ic_action_settings.png"
width="48" height="48" /> and add a new flash.</p>

<h2 id="L4334">Tracking and Ephemeris</h2>
Use GPS tracking to log your movement path to a file or display on a map. Find
sun and moon directions with the Ephemeris screen. 

<p>Four screens (tabs) are available: TRACKING, MAP, PLACES, EPHEMERIS.</p>
<a id="tracking"></a> 

<h3 id="L4342">TRACKING Screen</h3>

<p>From the Startup screen press the Tracking icon to reach the tracking
functionality.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking Icon" src="../images/Tracking Icon.png" width="80"
height="86" /></p>

<p>The tracking screen offers two key functionalities:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Tracking</dt>
    <dd>A location provider (such as GPS) is used to determine the current
      location coordinates, and often also other details such as altitude,
      speed and bearing of movement. This information is shown on the screen
      and updated when available.</dd>
    <dd>For GPS coordinates - depending on your device - it may take some time
      until the first fix is locked. In some instances, in particular within
      buildings you might not receive a GPS fix at all.</dd>
    <dd>The location provider can be changed in <em>Settings</em>, also while
      <em>Logging</em> is active.</dd>
  <dt>Logging</dt>
    <dd>The current location information is recorded. It can be stored to a
      file where both GPX and KML formats are supported, or shown on the MAP
      screen only.</dd>
    <dd>When you switch on <em>Logging</em>, the <em>Tracking</em>
      functionality is automatically enabled as well. You are able to switch
      off <em>Tracking</em> while <em>Logging</em> continues to be active. This
      can be used to save energy for example while inside a building or
      stationary at a location for some time.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img alt="Tracking screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Tracking_en_p.png"
width="295" height="504" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>While Logging is active both audio recordings and photos (taken with device
camera) can be associated with the current location. You might use this feature
to quickly record information about a place. For such recordings a marker is
shown on the map.</p>

<h4 id="L4396">Audio Recording</h4>

<p>Wile Logging is active you are able to record an audio message. This
recording is geocoded with the current location. In case the track is presented
on the map (MAP screen) then a marker icon in shape of a microphone is
shown.</p>

<p>Within Settings you can change the recording format between 3GP, MPEG4, AMR.
The recording file is stored in a folder for media files associated with the
track. The name is shown during the audio recording dialog.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Audio Recording"
src="../images/Screenshot_Tracking_Audio_recording_p.png" width="295"
height="505" /></p>

<h4 id="L4401">Finish Logging</h4>

<p><a id="audioRecording" name="audioRecording"></a>When you finish logging a
dialog appears to select what action to take. Use <em>Cancel</em> in case you
switched off logging in error.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking Stop Logging Screen"
src="../images/Screenshot_Tracking_Stop_Logging_Share.png" width="295"
height="175" /></p>

<p>You can <strong>share</strong> the log file, for example upload to cloud
storage, send via email, ...</p>

<p>Depending on your settings (see Settings) the log file together with audio
recordings and photos will be packaged as a ZIP file.</p>

<p>Please note that in case no records (for example no GPS fix could be
obtained yet) are logged when you stop, no data from that session are available
for sharing. Therefore in such situation pressing Share brings up a file
dialog. You can then either select an old recording for sharing or abort.</p>

<p>The following log file formats are supported:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>GPX</dt>
    <dd>The GPX file format records the path with timestamp, location
      coordinates, speed, course, elevation.</dd>
    <dd>This format is suitable for input into tools such as Adobe
    Lightroom.</dd>
  <dt>KML</dt>
    <dd>The KML file format records the path with timestamp and location
      coordinates.</dd>
    <dd>This format is suitable for Google applications.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="L4432">MAP Screen</h3>

<p>The MAP screen is based on Google Maps. It allows you to display the
recorded path, a previously logged path, or mark places (see PLACES screen). It
also allows you to present sun and moon data, such as the directions for rise
and set of sun and moon.</p>

<p>To display the map, Internet connectivity is required. You may use the
Google Map application to persist a map area for offline access.</p>

<h4 id="L2618">Map Button Row</h4>

<p>A row of icon buttons is located below the map display. These buttons
provide quick access to show particular information on the map.</p>

<p>You can either use the <img alt="overflow icon"
src="../images/ic_menu_moreoverflow_normal_holo_light.png" width="32"
height="32" />icon to navigate to the next or previous set of buttons or use a
sliding guesture.</p>

<p>On larger devices in landscape mode all buttons are shown without the need
to page through.</p>

<h4 id="L712">Map Tracking</h4>

<p>The Map screen allows to display the currently tracked path, and also load
previously saved ones.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Map Screen (Path)"
src="../images/Screenshot_Map_path_p.png" width="295" height="502" /></p>

<p>The icon <img alt="logger icon" src="../images/ic_tracking.png" width="32"
height="32" /><strong></strong> is used to present the <strong>currently logged
path</strong> on the map. Special markers are shown for audio recordings and
photos taken.</p>

<p>The icon <img alt="load track" src="../images/ic_menu_save.png" width="32"
height="32" /><strong></strong> allows to <strong>load an existing log
file</strong> and present the path on the map.</p>

<p>Use icon<img alt="clear all from map" src="../images/ic_clear.png"
width="32" height="32" /> to <strong>clear</strong> all markers and paths.</p>

<p>Use icon <img alt="overflow"
src="../images/ic_menu_moreoverflow_normal_holo_light.png" width="32"

<h4 id="L2669"><a id="MapEphemeris">Map Places</a></h4>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Map Screen (Places)"
src="../images/Screenshot_Map_p.png" width="295" height="503" /></p>

<h4 id="L741">Map Ephemeris</h4>

<p>The Map screen allows you to visualise the sun and moon directions; a great
way to plan the best location for your photo shoot.</p>

<p><img alt="Map ephemeris details"
src="../images/Screenshot_Map_ephemeris_p.png" width="295" height="503" /></p>

<p>The icon<img alt="sun icon" src="../images/ic_sun_up.png" width="32"

<p>The icon<img alt="my places icon" src="../images/ic_menu_myplaces.png"
width="32" height="32" /> show the currently chosen ephemeris location.</p>

<p>The icon<img alt="my location" src="../images/ic_menu_mylocation.png"
width="32" height="32" /> selects the current GPS location (if available) as
the ephemeris location.</p>

<p>The icon<img alt="search icon" src="../images/ic_menu_search.png" width="32"
height="32" /> initiates a location search.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img alt="Ephemeris screen with time slider"
src="../images/Screenshot_Map_ephemeris_time_p.png" width="295" height="503"
/></p>

<p>Use the slider to change the time of day and see how sun and moon direction
changes.</p>

<p>The<img alt="time now icon" src="../images/ic_dialog_time.png" width="32"
height="32" /> icon sets the current date and time.</p>
<a id="places"></a> 

<h3 id="L4469">PLACES Screen</h3>

<p>The PLACES screen is used to load places (<strong><em>Load KML</em>
</strong>button<strong></strong>) of interest from KML files.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Places Screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Places_p.png"
width="295" height="505" /></p>

<p>The list of loaded places can be sorted either alphabetically or by distance
from current location (if current location is available).</p>

<p>Click on one place and the MAP screen is shown, positioned for this
place.</p>

<p>Use the <strong><em>On Map</em> </strong>button<strong></strong> to put
markers for all places in the list onto the map (does not automatically move to
MAP screen!). You can do this for multiple places lists.</p>
<a id="Ephemeris"></a> 

<h3 id="L3403">EPHEMERIS Screen</h3>

<p>The ephemeris screen provides you with a wide variety of sun and moon
related calculations. It includes rise and set times and directions, twilight
times, moon phase.</p>

<p>For these calculations you need to set both the geographic location and
time/date.</p>

<p>The <a href="#L3413">compass rose</a> visualises the rise, set and time
specific directions, and also indicates the altitude above / below horizon for
sun and moon throughout a day.</p>

<p>The compass rose turns to show the actual direction. Please note that this
compass functionality is only available if your device has the necessary
sensors builtin. The accuracy of directions depends on surrounding influences
such as magnetic and electrical devices.</p>

<p>Ephemeris related settings are available to customise the colors used.</p>

<p><img alt="Ephemeris screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Ephemeris_all_p.png"
width="295" height="1107" /></p>

<p>First you need to choose a <strong>location</strong>. There are multiple
options to do this:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Drop-Down Selection:</dt>
    <dd>Use the drop-down to select a predefined location. There are also two
      special location types: <em>Current GPS Location</em> and <em>User
      Location</em>.</dd>
    <dd>In case the location of interest isn't already defined, you may define
      either a User Location or press the<img alt="settings location list"
      src="../images/ic_action_settings.png" width="48" height="48" /> icon to
      open the <a href="#L6553">locations list</a> to enter the location
      definition. Or start a location search by pressing the<img
      alt="location search" src="../images/ic_menu_search.png" width="32"
      height="32" /> icon.</dd>
  <dt>Current GPS Location:</dt>
    <dd>In case a GPS location is available it can be selected for the
      Ephemeris calculations. Please note that the Ephemeris screen is a
      passive listener to GPS locations (which does not draw extra power), and
      therefore only receives location information if requested by some other
      activity (other application or tracking is enable on TRACKING
    screen).</dd>
    <dd>Once a GPS location is set, the position latitude and longitude
      coordinates are shown.</dd>
  <dt>User Location</dt>
    <dd>A User Location is a temporary location, which can be set through a <a
      href="#L3018">location search</a> or by moving the location marker on the
      MAP screen.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Once a location is defined, the timezone will be set where possible.
Alternatively you might select from the timezone drop-down (which is a quite
long list).</p>

<p><em>Important: Times shown on this screen are expressed in terms of this
timezone, except for the graph where the location location timezone is
applied!</em></p>

<p>Next set the <strong>date and time</strong> for this calculation using the
buttons. To get the current date / time press <strong><img alt="time now"
src="../images/ic_dialog_time.png" width="32" height="32" />.</strong></p>

<h4 id="L4345">Graph</h4>

<p>The graph presents the sun and moon altitudes throughout a day. The current
time is marked by a vertical line. A slider below the graph allows to change
the time of the day for the calculation.</p>

<h4 id="L3413">Compass Rose</h4>

<p><img alt="Compass rose" src="../images/Screenshot_Compass_en.png"
width="295" height="316" /></p>

<p>The compass rose presents:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compass direction (if enabled using the toggle ON / OFF button just above
    the compass rose)</li>
  <li>Sun rise direction</li>
  <li>Sun set direction</li>
  <li>Sun direction at specified time of day (with sun symbol)</li>
  <li>Sun altitude throughout the day</li>
  <li>Moon rise direction</li>
  <li>Moon set direction</li>
  <li>Moon direction at specified time of day (with moon symbol)</li>
  <li>Moon altitude throughout the day</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that an altitude below horizon is shown as dashed line.</p>

<p>Colors can be changed using the <img alt="settings ephemeris"
src="../images/ic_action_settings.png" width="48" height="48" /> icon below the
compass rose.</p>

<p>To save batterie power you are able to switch off the compass direction
movement of the rose. When switched off the northern direction is always show
on top. In Settings you are able to configure the application to automatically
switch off the compass if the battery level is low.</p>

<p>While the compass is on, the strength of the detected magnetic field is
shown in micro tesla. Typical earth magnetic field readings are in a range
between 30 and 60 micro tesla. The value is shown in red when outside this
range. In particular higher values indicate other magnetic or electric sources.
When using the compass, to get a good direction accuracy please ensure that you
are away from magnetic or electric sources.</p>

<p><a id="EphemerisCalculations"></a> </p>

<h4 id="L3415">Ephemeris Calculations</h4>

<p>The Calculations section of this screen provides detailed time, azimuth and
altitude values for sun and moon based on the set location and date. Also the
used colors are visualized.</p>

  <dt>Viewing Distance</dt>
    <dd>The anticipated closest viewing distance is entered in meter.</dd>
    <dd>By default the CoC calculation uses the natural human viewing distance
      based on the 'comfortable' viewing angle of the human eye. This is often
      a good value, but in some circumstance you may want to provide an
      explicit minimum viewing distance. For example, the viewer is unable to
      get any closer to the print, and therefor the sharpness requirements are
      less. Alternatively, you might anticipate the view to perform a 'close
      inspection' and still would like to present the image with full
    sharpness.</dd>
