<p><strong>The ideal photography tool when travelling!</strong></p>

<p>Photoxor C1 is a photography tool for <strong>exposure</strong> and
<strong>depth of field</strong> calculations, <strong>GPS location
tracking</strong>. Visualise locations on map, and quickly see what's closest
to you.</p>

<p>Use the device camera based <strong>lightmeter</strong> to estimate an
Exposure Value (EV) reading, determine camera settings and calculate
adjustments needed for a (neutral density) filter.</p>

<p>The Depth of Field calculation shows the near and far limits of sharpness,
and additionally provides a graphical visualisation of the level of sharpness
and diffraction. The Circle of Confusion (CoC) is automatically calculated from
the camera sensor size, but may be overridden with a custom value.</p>

<p>The Depth of Field calculation now also allows specifying the range of
sharpness (near and far limits) and calculates the needed camera settings.</p>

<p><strong>Location tracking</strong> is available to record your path of
travel. You can also record audio notes to quickly store information on your
way. For reference you may want to take geotagged photographs with your device
camera.</p>

<p>The key features are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aperture, time, ISO<br />
    Exposure calculations and Exposure Value (EV)</li>
  <li>Lightmeter (using device camera)</li>
  <li>ND filters and &ldquo;Black Glass&rdquo;<br />
    Calculation on how a ND filter light reductions affects exposure
  settings</li>
  <li>Depth of Field calculations with graphical presentation of distance
    dependent sharpness level (CoC)</li>
  <li>Depth of Field reverse calculation<br />
    Camera settings are determined based on required near and far sharpness
    limits </li>
  <li>Field of View calculation<br />
    Both dimensional and angular<br />
    also dimensional reverse calculation </li>
  <li>Define own cameras and custom Circle of Confusion (CoC)</li>
  <li>Define own filter characteristics (light reduction)</li>
  <li>Set your stop system (full, ½, 1/3, ¼ stops)</li>
  <li>Customize light wavelength for diffraction calculation (Airy Disk)</li>
  <li>Track your path of travel and visualise on map</li>
  <li>Save GPS tracking path on GPX or KML files</li>
  <li>Load location information from KML files and visualise on map</li>
  <li>Show current distance from your locations of interest</li>
  <li>Configure screen background</li>
</ul>

<p>A number of in-app purchases are now available to further extend
capabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Advertisement free:</strong> Get more screen space by removing
    the advertisement banner.</li>
  <li><strong>High Precision:</strong> An essential feature for the serious
    photographer!<br />
    Get your calculation outputs (depth of field, field of view) in high
    precision - configure between 2 and 8 significant digits results. </li>
  <li><strong>Filter Stack:</strong> Define multiple stacked (neutral density)
    filters and calculate the resulting effect.</li>
  <li><strong>Tracking Pro:</strong> Get unlimited tracking capability. The
    time limit for audio recordings is removed, and there is also no limit to a
    logging session.</li>
</ul>
