<h2 id="L4277">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is for Photoxor Timelapse version 1.0, which can be installed
or updated for free from Google Play</p>

<p><a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.photoxor.timelapse"><img
alt="Get it on Google Play"
src="https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png" />
</a></p>

<p>Photoxor Timelapse provides <strong>time-lapse calculations</strong> to
determine the capture parameters for a time-lapse video clip.</p>

<p>It also has a simple <strong>flashlight</strong> application using the
device camera flash LED as light source.</p>

<p>An application <strong>widget</strong> allows quick access to the
calculations and also to the <strong>Torch</strong> function.</p>

<p>A number of in-app purchases are available to further extend
capabilities.</p>

<p>For latest information, tips and tricks please visit the <a
href="http://photoxor.blogspot.com.au/">Photoxor Blog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="L424">Permissions Required</h2>

<p>Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) introduced a new permissions model (see <a
href="http://www.howtogeek.com/230683/how-to-manage-app-permissions-on-android-6.0/">here</a>
for some information). When you run the application on Android 6.0 or later,
permission are granted by the user while the app is running. You are now able
to deny particular permissions, and also revoke already granted permissions.</p>

<p>Please note that in case permissions are not granted or revoked, the
application might not work correctly and is limited in functionality.</p>

<p>These permissions are:</p>

<p><strong>CAMERA</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Torch</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>STORAGE</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Store configuration</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="L4316">Home Screen</h2>

<p>The Home Screen provides the visual entry point into the application. Icons
give you a one-click access to most of the application features. Color coding
is used to present functionality grouping.</p>

<p>Please click the icon button to open the function screen.</p>

<p><img alt="Startup Screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Startup_p.png"
width="295" height="498" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>There is one exception: the Torch function does not open a screen, but
switches the Torch on or off:</p>

<p><img alt="icon torch" src="../images/Start-Icon-Torch_en.png" width="80"
height="80" /></p>

<p>Please note that the torch icon is only shown if the device supports a
camera flash function (the LED used by the torch).</p>

<h3 id="L4323">Icon Arrangement</h3>

<p>The Home Screen presents a number of icons as shortcuts for access to
functionality of the application. The default arrangement might not be the best
for your particular usage, and therefore prefer to rearrange icons. To do this,
<strong>press and hold on the icon</strong> you want to move. On this 'long
press' an array of squares shows up (see image) and you are now able to drag
the chosen icon to one of the squares. As soon as you end the drag, the icon
will be placed on the target square, and the array of squares disappears. In
case you drag to a square already holding an icon, this icon will be moved
away.</p>

<p><img alt="Rearrange icons"
src="../images/Screenshot_Startup_rearrange_icons_p.png" width="295"
height="504" /></p>

<p>Please repeat this process for other icons you want to rearrange. Separate
arrangements can be performed for portrait and landscape screen views.</p>

<p>New versions of the application may introduce new icons. They are placed
onto one of the free positions, and you are able to then rearrange these new
icons.</p>

<h3 id="L1920">Navigation Drawer</h3>

<p>The Navigation Drawer is an additional feature to quickly access application
functionality. To open the drawer please press the top left area of the action
bar (where you see the three horizontal lines, the Photoxor icon and the
application name Photoxor C1. The navigation drawer opens and you are able to
scroll through the functions provided. Click on one of the functions and
directly go to the screen.</p>

<p><img alt="navigation drawer" src="../images/Screenshot_NavDrawer_en.png"
width="295" height="484" /></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><img alt="Navigation drawer - tools"
src="../images/Screenshot_NavDrawer_p_en.png" width="295" height="502" /></p>

<p>Please note that the Torch function is shown only when supported by your
device.</p>
<a id="startScreenFavourites"></a> 

<h3 id="L496">Home Screen Configuration</h3>

<p>For each function the Navigation Drawer shows a STAR icon, which allows to
either place this function on the start screen (start in yellow) or hide it
(start in grey). Now you are able to configure your individual start screen.</p>

<p>Don't want to show the start screen at all?</p>

<p>Then on the Navigation Drawer just select exactly one function, and the
corresponding screen replaces your start screen.</p>

<h2 id="L4883">Application Widgets</h2>

<p>When you install Photoxor C1 a number of application widgets are installed
as well. You can find them in the list of widgets for your device.</p>

<p>Please note that widgets are not available when you move the application to
the SD card; this is a behaviour of Android.</p>

<h3 id="L515">Full Widget 4x1</h3>

<p><img alt="Widget 2" src="../images/appwidget2_preview_295x70.png"
width="295" height="70" /></p>

<p>This widget provides</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Photoxor icon to quickly start the application.</li>
  <li>The Location Tracking start / pause icon.</li>
  <li>The Location Tracking stop icon. On switching off the log data are
    written to a logging file (as configured in Settings).</li>
  <li>The Torch icon switches the torch on / off. Please note the automatic
    switch-off time, which can be configured in Settings. This function is
    implemented to protect battery usage and avoid overheating of device.
    Default is a 30 seconds on time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="L468">Full Widget 4x1 (old)</h3>

<p>This widget is retained for legacy use. We recommend using the new 4x1
widget.</p>

<p><img alt="widget" src="../images/Screenshot_Widget_en.png" width="295"
height="70" /></p>

<p>This widget provides</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Photoxor icon to quickly start the application.</li>
  <li>The Tracking icon switches location tracking on / off.</li>
  <li>The Logging icon switches location logging on / off. On switching off the
    log data are written to a logging file (as configured in Settings).</li>
  <li>The Torch icon switches the torch on / off. Please note the automatic
    switch-off time, which can be configured in Settings. This function is
    implemented to protect battery usage and avoid overheating of device.
    Default is a 30 seconds on time.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case the torch function is not supported by the device, the torch button
is not presented and the widget looks like this:</p>

<p><img alt="widget without torch button"
src="../images/Screenshot_Widget_no_torch_en.png" width="262" height="70" /></p>

<h3 id="L495">Torch Only Widget 1x1</h3>

<p>Photoxor C1 also supports a small widget to switch on / off the torch
function.</p>

<p><img alt="torch only widget"
src="../../torch/images/appwidget_preview_torchonly_1x1_141x138.png" width="72"
height="70" /></p>


<h2 id="L1469">Tools </h2>

<a id="Timelapse"></a> 
<h2 id="L583">Timelapse Calculations</h2>

<p>"Time-lapse photography is a technique whereby the frequency at which film
frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the
sequence. When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and
thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every
second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30
times speed increase." (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-lapse_photography">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

<p>The new time-lapses calculation tool helps to determine the correct camera
recording settings for creation of a time-lapse clip.The calculation is
performed in a few simple steps:</p>

<p><img alt="Timelapse calculation screen"
src="../images/Screenshot_Timelapse_p_en_std 295.png" width="295" height="510"
/></p>

<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>First, define the length of the expected clip and the frame rate (frames
    per second - FPS). The tool now calculates the number of frames (images)
    required.</li>
  <li>Following define how the capture is done. For time-lapse the capture
    duration is much longer than the playback. Once the duration is defined,
    the tool calculates the required recording interval.</li>
  <li>Optionally you might want to set the anticipated start date/time, and get
    the finishing time.</li>
  <li>Make sure your camera memory is sufficient to hold the captured images.
    Enter the approximate image size and get the amount of storage needed.</li>
  <li>Now setup your camera, program the interval timer with the shooting
    interval and number of images required.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="L613">Time-lapse Pro</h3>

<p>The "Time-lapse Pro" extension enhances the time-lapse tool features.</p>

<p>Duration and Interval values are presented as days, hours, minutes, seconds
and tenth of seconds.</p>

<p><img alt="Timelapse Screen - Pro"
src="../images/Screenshot_Timelapse_p_en_pro_295.png" width="295" height="504"
/></p>

<p></p>

<h4 id="L624">Graphical Dials</h4>

<p>Keyboard entry on a small device is cumbersome? Then try the dial type data
entry for duration and intervals. It allows to precisely enter in days, hours,
minutes, seconds, down to a tenth of a second.</p>

<p>Go to settings <img alt="settings button"
src="../images/Settings_button.png" width="26" height="26" /> and change the
"Duration / Interval entry" to "Dial picker".</p>

<p><img alt="Timelapse Screen - Pro"
src="../images/Screenshot_Timelapse_p_en_pro_295.png" width="295" height="504"
/></p>

<p></p>
<a id="FpsList"></a> <a id="FpsDetails"></a> 

<h4 id="L645">Custom defined Frame rates (FPS)</h4>

<p>In addition to the provided standard frame rates you are able to define your
own playback frame rates for a most accurate calculation.</p>

<p><img alt="FPS List" src="../images/Screenshot_Fps_list_p_295.png"
width="295" height="524" /></p>
<a id="TimelapseScenario"></a> <a id="TimelapseScenarioDetail"></a> 

<h4 id="L659">Named Scenarios</h4>

<p>Did you find your 'perfect' time-lapse setting for a particular situation?
Then store it as a named scenario for later reuse.</p>

<p>On the Timelapse screen you find this button: <img
alt="Button user selection for timelapse scenario"
src="../images/Button_User_Sel.png" width="26" height="26" /></p>

<p><strong>Short press</strong>: The following dialog is opened and allows to
</p>
<ul>
  <li>select one of the stored scenaros,</li>
  <li>add the current setting as a new scenario,</li>
  <li>open the timelapse scenario list.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Timelapse scenario selection"
src="../images/Screenshot_Timelapse_Scenario_Sel_p_295.png" width="295"
height="524" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Long press</strong>: Directly adds the current scenario as a new
one. Add your own name for this scenario and press SAVE.</p>

<p><img alt="Timelapse scenario detail"
src="../images/Screenshot_Timelapse_Scenario_Detail_p_295.png" width="295"
height="524" /></p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="L1471">Torch</h3>

<p>The Torch screen allows to switch on / of the light. If the automatic
switch-off timer is set, the time countdown is shown (remaining minute and
seconds).</p>

<p>A <strong>click</strong> on the countdown time resets the timer.</p>

<p>A '<strong>long click</strong>' on the countdown time opens the settings
screen, and allows you for example to change the switch-off time.</p>

<p><img alt="torch screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Torch_p_en.png"
width="295" height="503" /></p>
<a id="notifications"></a> 

<h2 id="L1550">Notifications</h2>

<p>You may receive notifications from time to time on new application features,
