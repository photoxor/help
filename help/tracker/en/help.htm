<h1>Photoxor Tracker </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>With <b>Photoxor Tracker</b> you are able to track and record you path,
visualize the track together with your favourite locations on a map, and
quickly see what's closest to you. Record audio notes to quickly store
information on your way, take geotagged photographs with your device camera.
Store your favourite locations in KML files and load them into Tracker. You are
able to present them on the map, but also list them in order of distance from
your current location.</p>

<p>Select your preferred location provider:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GPS</b> for the most accurate tracking, but depending on your device
    mayconsume more power</li>
  <li><b>Network cell</b> information uses less power, but provides only
    approximate location<b></b></li>
  <li><b>Passive</b> uses no additional power, but receives location
    information only when another application on your device requests it; good
    for background tracking. </li>
</ul>

<p>A number of in-app purchases are now available to further extend
capabilities.</p>

<p>Please note that the accuracy of tracking is dependent on the GPS
capabilities of your device.</p>

<p>Are you are photographer, professional or enthusiast? Then have a look at
Photoxor C1; it provides tracking and additionally photography calculations.</p>

<p>Get it for free from Google Play: <a

<h2>Startup Screen</h2>

<h3>Icon Arrangement</h3>

<p>The startup screen presents a number of icons as shortcuts for access to
functionality of the application. The default arrangement might not be the best
for your particular usage, and therefore prefer to rearrange icons. To do this,
press and hold on the icon you want to move. On this 'long press' an array of
square shows up (see image) and you are now able to drag the chosen icon to one
of the squares. As soon as you end the drag, the icon will be placed on the
target square, and the array of squares dissapears. In case you drag to a
square already holding an icon, this icon will be moved away.</p>

<p>Please repeat this process for other icons you want to rearrange. Different
arrangement can be performed for portrait and landscape screen views.</p>

<p>New versions of the application may introduce new icons. They are placed
onto one of the free positions, and you are able to then rearrange these new
icons.</p>

<h3>TRACKING Screen</h3>

<p>From the Startup screen press the Tracking icon to reach the tracking
functionality.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking Icon" src="../images/Tracking Icon.png" width="80"
height="86" /></p>

<p>The tracking screen offers two key functionalities:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Tracking</dt>
    <dd>A location provider (such as GPS) is used to determine the current
      location coordinates, and often also other details such as altitude,
      speed and bearing of movement. This information is shown on the screen
      and updated when available.</dd>
    <dd>For GPS coordinates - depending on your device - it may take some time
      until the first fix is locked. In some instances, in particular within
      buildings you might not get a GPS fix at all.</dd>
    <dd>The location provider can be changed in <em>Settings</em>, also while
      <em>Logging</em> is active.</dd>
  <dt>Logging</dt>
    <dd>The current location information is recorded. It can be stored to a
      file where both GPX and KML formats are supported, or shown on the MAP
      screen only.</dd>
    <dd>When you switch on <em>Logging</em>, the <em>Tracking</em>
      functionality is automatically enabled as well. But you are able to
      switch off <em>Tracking</em> while <em>Logging</em> continues to be
      active. This can be used to save energy for example while inside a
      building or stationary at a location for some time.</dd>
</dl>

<p></p>

<p>While Logging is active both audio recordings and photos (taken with device
camera) can be associated with the current location. You might use this feature
to quickly record information about a place.</p>

<a id="map"></a>

<h3>MAP Screen</h3>

<p>The MAP screen is based on Google Maps. It allows you to display the
recorded path, a previously logged path, or mark places (see PLACES screen).</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Map Screen (Path)"

<p></p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Map Screen (Places)"
src="../images/Screenshot_Map_p.png" width="295" height="503" /></p>

<p>The <strong><em>Logger</em> button</strong> is used to present the currently
logged path on the map.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Load Log File</em> button</strong> allows to load an
existing log file and present the path on the map.</p>

<p>Use the <strong><em>None</em> button</strong> to clear markers and path.</p>
<a id="places"></a>

<h3>PLACES Screen</h3>

<p>The PLACES screen is used to load places (<strong><em>Load KML</em>
button</strong>) of interest from KML files.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Places Screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Places_p.png"
width="295" height="505" /></p>

<p>The list of loaded places can be sorted either alphabetically or by distance
from current location (if current location is available).</p>

<p>Click on one place and the MAP screen is shown positioned on this place.</p>

<p>Use the <strong><em>On Map</em> button</strong> to put markers for all
places in the list onto the map (does not automatically move to MAP screen!).
You can do this for multiple places lists.</p>
