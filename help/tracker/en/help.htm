<h2 id="L4277">Introduction</h2>

<p>With <b>Photoxor Tracker</b> you are able to track and record you path,
visualize the track together with your favourite locations on a map, and
quickly see what's closest to you. Record audio notes to quickly store
information on your way, take geotagged photographs with your device camera.
Store your favourite locations in KML files and load them into Tracker. You are
able to present them on the map, but also list them in order of distance from
your current location.</p>

<p>Select your preferred location provider:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GPS</b> for the most accurate tracking, but depending on your device
    may consume more power</li>
  <li><b>Network cell</b> information uses less power, but provides only
    approximate location<b></b></li>
  <li><b>Passive</b> uses no additional power, but receives location
    information only when another application on your device requests it; good
    for background tracking. </li>
</ul>

<p>A number of in-app purchases are available to further extend
capabilities.</p>

<p>Please note that the accuracy of tracking is dependent on the GPS
capabilities of your device.</p>

<p>Are you are photographer, professional or enthusiast? Then have a look at
Photoxor C1; it provides tracking and additionally photography calculations.</p>

<p>Get it for free from <a
href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.photoxor.fotoapp">Google
Play</a>.</p>

<h2 id="L4316">Startup Screen</h2>

<p>The Startup Screen provides the visual entry point into the application.
Icons give you a one-click access to most of the application features. Color
coding is used to present functionality grouping.</p>

<p><img alt="Startup Screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Startup_p.png"
width="295" height="498" /></p>

<h3 id="L4323">Icon Arrangement</h3>

<p>The startup screen presents a number of icons as shortcuts for access to
functionality of the application. The default arrangement might not be the best
for your particular usage, and therefore prefer to rearrange icons. To do this,
<strong>press and hold on the icon</strong> you want to move. On this 'long
press' an array of squares shows up (see image) and you are now able to drag
the chosen icon to one of the squares. As soon as you end the drag, the icon
will be placed on the target square, and the array of squares dissapears. In
case you drag to a square already holding an icon, this icon will be moved
away.</p>

<p><img alt="Rearrange icons"
src="../images/Screenshot_Startup_rearrange_icons_p.png" width="295"
height="504" /></p>

<p>Please repeat this process for other icons you want to rearrange. Different
arrangements can be performed for portrait and landscape screen views.</p>

<p>New versions of the application may introduce new icons. They are placed
onto one of the free positions, and you are able to then rearrange these new
icons.</p>

<h2 id="L4334">Tracking</h2>
<a id="tracking"></a> Use GPS tracking to log your movement path to a file or
display on a map. 

<p>Three screens (tabs) are available: TRACKING, MAP, PLACES</p>

<h3 id="L4342">TRACKING Screen</h3>

<p>From the Startup screen press the Tracking icon to reach the tracking
functionality.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking Icon" src="../images/Tracking Icon.png" width="80"
height="86" /></p>

<p>The tracking screen offers two key functionalities:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Tracking</dt>
    <dd>A location provider (such as GPS) is used to determine the current
      location coordinates, and often also other details such as altitude,
      speed and bearing of movement. This information is shown on the screen
      and updated when available.</dd>
    <dd>For GPS coordinates - depending on your device - it may take some time
      until the first fix is locked. In some instances, in particular within
      buildings you might not receive a GPS fix at all.</dd>
    <dd>The location provider can be changed in <em>Settings</em>, also while
      <em>Logging</em> is active.</dd>
  <dt>Logging</dt>
    <dd>The current location information is recorded. It can be stored to a
      file where both GPX and KML formats are supported, or shown on the MAP
      screen only.</dd>
    <dd>When you switch on <em>Logging</em>, the <em>Tracking</em>
      functionality is automatically enabled as well. You are able to switch
      off <em>Tracking</em> while <em>Logging</em> continues to be active. This
      can be used to save energy for example while inside a building or
      stationary at a location for some time.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img alt="Tracking screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Tracking_en_p.png"
width="295" height="504" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>While Logging is active both audio recordings and photos (taken with device
camera) can be associated with the current location. You might use this feature
to quickly record information about a place. For such recordings a marker is
shown on the map.</p>

<h4 id="L4396">Audio Recording</h4>

<p>Wile Logging is active you are able to record an audio message. This
recording is geocoded with the current location. In case the track is presented
on the map (MAP screen) then a marker icon in shape of a microphone is
shown.</p>

<p>Within Settings you can change the recording format between 3GP, MPEG4, AMR.
The recording file is stored in a folder for media files associated with the
track. The name is shown during the audio recording dialog.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Audio Recording"
src="../images/Screenshot_Tracking_Audio_recording_p.png" width="295"
height="505" /></p>

<h4 id="L4401">Finish Logging</h4>

<p><a id="audioRecording" name="audioRecording"></a>When you finish logging a
dialog appears to select what action to take. Use <em>Cancel</em> in case you
switched off logging in error.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking Stop Logging Screen"
src="../images/Screenshot_Tracking_Stop_Logging_Share.png" width="295"
height="175" /></p>

<p>You can <strong>share</strong> the log file, for example upload to cloud
storage, send via email, ...</p>

<p>Depending on your settings (see Settings) the log file together with audio
recordings and photos will be packaged as a ZIP file.</p>

<p>Please note that in case no records (for example no GPS fix could be
obtained yet) are logged when you stop, no data from that session are available
for sharing. Therefore in such situation pressing Share brings up a file
dialog. You can then either select an old recording for sharing or abort.</p>

<p>The folloing log file formats are supported:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>GPX</dt>
    <dd>The GPX file format records the path with timestamp, location
      coordinates, speed, course, elevation.</dd>
    <dd>This format is suitable for input into tools such as Adobe
    Lightroom.</dd>
  <dt>KML</dt>
    <dd>The KML file format records the path with timestamp and location
      coordinates.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="L4432">MAP Screen</h3>

<p>The MAP screen is based on Google Maps. It allows you to display the
recorded path, a previously logged path, or mark places (see PLACES screen).</p>

<p>To show the map, Internet connectivity is required. You may use Google Map
to persist a map area for offline access.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Map Screen (Path)"
src="../images/Screenshot_Map_path_p.png" width="295" height="502" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Map Screen (Places)"
src="../images/Screenshot_Map_p.png" width="295" height="503" /></p>

<p>The <strong><em>Logger</em> </strong>button<strong></strong> is used to
present the currently logged path on the map. Special markers are shown for
audio recordings and photos taken.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Load Log File</em> </strong>button<strong></strong> allows
to load an existing log file and present the path on the map.</p>

<p>Use the <strong><em>None</em> </strong>button<strong></strong> to clear all
markers and path.</p>
<a id="places"></a> 

<h3 id="L4469">PLACES Screen</h3>

<p>The PLACES screen is used to load places (<strong><em>Load KML</em>
</strong>button<strong></strong>) of interest from KML files.</p>

<p><img alt="Tracking - Places Screen" src="../images/Screenshot_Places_p.png"
width="295" height="505" /></p>

<p>The list of loaded places can be sorted either alphabetically or by distance
from current location (if current location is available).</p>

<p>Click on one place and the MAP screen is shown, positioned for this
place.</p>

<p>Use the <strong><em>On Map</em> </strong>button<strong></strong> to put
markers for all places in the list onto the map (does not automatically move to
MAP screen!). You can do this for multiple places lists.</p>
