<p>With <b>Photoxor Tracker</b> you are able to track and record you path,
visualize the track together with your favourite locations on a map, and
quickly see what's closest to you. Record audio notes to quickly store
information on your way, take geotagged photographs with your device camera.
Store your favourite locations in KML files and load them into Tracker. You are
able to present them on the map, but also list them in order of distance from
your current location.</p>

<p>Select your preferred location provider:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GPS</b> for the most accurate tracking, but depending on your device
    mayconsume more power</li>
  <li><b>Network cell</b> information uses less power, but provides only
    approximate location<b></b></li>
  <li><b>Passive</b> uses no additional power, but receives location
    information only when another application on your device requests it; good
    for background tracking. </li>
</ul>

<p>A number of in-app purchases are now available to further extend
capabilities.</p>

<p>Please note that the accuracy of tracking is dependent on the GPS
capabilities of your device.</p>
