<p>With <b>Photoxor Tracker</b> you are able to track and record you path,
visualize the track together with your favourite locations on a map, and quickly see what's closest to you. 
Record audio notes to quickly store information on your way, take geotagged photographs with your device camera.

Store your favourite locations in KML files and load them into Tracker. 
You are able to present them on the map, but also list them in order of distance from your current location.<br /><br />
Select your preferred location provider:<br />
<b>GPS</b> for the most accurate tracking, 
but depending on your device may consume more power<br />
<b>Network cell</b>information uses less power, but provides only approximate location<br />
<b>Passive</b> uses no additional power, but receives location information only when another application on your device requests it; 
good for background tracking.<br /><br />A number of in-app purchases are now available to further extend capabilities.

Please note that the accuracy of tracking is dependent on the GPS capabilities of your device.<br /><br />Are you are photographer, professional or enthusiast? Then have a look at Photoxor C1; it provides tracking and additionally photography calculations.
